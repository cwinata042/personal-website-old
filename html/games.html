          Project Sekai is by far my favorite mobile rhythm game!
          It has a nice combination of catchy and nostalgic songs, cute and memorable characters, and a difficult yet fun rhythm game mechanics.
          I started playing Project Sekai when beta testing first became available, and once it came out in the Japanese Apple Store, I immediately downloaded the game.</p>
        <p>
          Although I am not a huge fan of gacha games, especially because of my non-existent luck pulling the characters I want, I love the game.
          In many other rhythm games, you are restricted by some sort of stamina system, and in some games, you can only play 4-5 songs every 12 hours.
          Project Sekai has a system where you can play as many songs as you want, and the stamina (called energy) increases the rewards you get for playing.
          As someone who enjoys the game more for the rhythm aspect, this is a feature I hope will become more popular in other games!

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <img src="../images/prsekai-gameplay.jpg" class="center topmargin" style="width:50%">
        <p>
          The game mechanics are relatively simple and similar to another arcade rhythm game called Chunithm.
          There is a horizontal playing space at the bottom of the screen (although you can tap the space above this bar).
          There are 3 types of notes, tap, hold/slide, and flick, which are denoted by different colors: white, green, and red.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are options to change the volume of different SFX and VFX, and you can even turn off the skill pop ups that may distract you while playing.
          Personally, I turn most visual effects off, including the 3D music video, because I like to get rid of any distractions.

        <h2>Characters</h2>
        <p>
          I usually don't pay attention to characters in rhythm gacha games, solely because I don't want to get too attached to a character and wind up never getting their card.
          However, some of the designs and character voices are too good to pass, so here are some of my favorite characters and the cards I have gotten of them!

      <h1>Genshin Impact</h1>

      <div class="column left topmargin">
        <p>
          When I first got into Genshin Impact, I thought I would play the game for a week and get bored of it pretty quickly.
          The game is now celebrating its 1st anniversary, and I have been playing it every day ever since release.
          This was my first anime style open-world RPG, and I am glad that I found it!
          I love open-world games that reward you for exploring every nook and corner, so I was excited to see that treasure chest hunting and puzzle solving was a big part of the game.
        </p>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>
          For me, the game is split into different kinds of gameplay.
          Once you hit AR 45 (your account's level), almost everything you can do in the game is available to you.
          You could either finish the many world quests or story quests, or you could also go chest hunting in the 3 regions.
          They even added a system for building your own mini world, and there's even fishing!
          Or you could be like me and collect every resource in the game with the aim of capping out your inventory limit because...reasons?
        </p>

        <p>
          Unfortunately, the game does start to feel repetitive as you grind for materials to level your characters and, more importantly, try to get good artifacts or equipment for them.
          Most of the friends I started off playing with no longer log in to the game, and if they do, it is only for a few minutes to finish dailies.
          But since I enjoy the mundane tasks of collecting items and grinding for materials, I still enjoy playing the game!
        </p>

        <h2>Visuals/Sound</h2>
        <p>
          MiHoYo really does not disappoint with their design and music team.
          The visual style of the game is a bit cartoonish in terms of shading and coloring, but the locations and characters are still absolutely stunning.
          The designs of each region are unique, and it really brings out the personality of each region!
          Not only that, but the BGM matches each region's theme and mood perfectly!

            1) Tartaglia has visually pleasing attack animations and one of the most fun kits in the game!
            <br>
            2) Kazuha's jump skill is extremely useful in overworld, especially when you are exploring.
            <br>
            3) Hu Tao has another fun kit, one that requires to keep a close eye on your HP bar!
